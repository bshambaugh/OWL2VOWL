@bhaugen Yes, I know about Gojs. I like them too. I'd probably go for sigma.js a step beyond color coding D3 graphs by namespace as its free, and it is good enough for me, and hopefully others, at the moment. There are a lot of visualization libraries out there, and I am not wanting to compete with them at the moment. I'm enticed by open question answering on the semantic web to make web data more easily searchable (not a domain ontology, not a closed KB, but heterogeneous data) There aren't many doing that in the open domain from what I see, and I envision it could be useful for networks of networks, or as I see it many LDP servers, related semantic data and perhaps documents. Miriam Fernandez and Vanessa Lopez looked into this, as late as five years ago, at the Knowledge Media Institute, and were pioneers.

OOps, gojs not free? I got transfixed by the diagrams and then got involved in a side conversation before I found the source.

Sigma.js has zooming, nooverlap detection (to avoid overlap of labels), customization of nodes...etc...It uses code from the Gephi project.
https://gephi.org/
I recall Gephi has an RDF plugin.
...the plugin was created by Dr. Fabian Gandon.

VOWL looks pretty nice. If I were to replicate that I would have to write code to match the styling to the underlying data. (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/v2/) As it is my code is quite simple. (it is a obvious modification of this: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045). It adds node and edge labels. It uses ellipses instead of circles. It adds collision detection. There is only one color defined by the group , and the object I input to d3 looks like this (except for two main substitutions):
{"links":[{"source":"http://localhost/node-arc-p5/data/Food-Growing-Methods.ttl","target":"\"Food Growing Methods\"","value":1,"label":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"},{"source":"http://localhost/node-arc-p5/data/Food-Growing-Methods.ttl","target":"\"For independence and resource optimization, some or all of the astronauts diet must be grown in-situ.

should i try it on our ttl file?
(I'm fine with webvowl too, but right now i can't get it to work - probably my error somewhere, although the ttl validates in a couple of tools)
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 15:15
If you want. git clone https://github.com/bshambaugh/node-arc-d3.git
Modify d3sketch.js url variable to be:
var url = "path to what you have got"; in https://github.com/bshambaugh/node-arc-d3/blob/master/js/d3sketch.js
do this where you want to serve it
it is easy to cd to /var/www/html , git clone https://github.com/bshambaugh/node-arc-d3.git and then localhost/node-arc-d3 in the browser
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn

Mar 21 16:34
thanks! i hope you get farther than me!
i even cut it down to one class, still couldn't get it to load
although i haven't gotten that exact error

Ontology could not be loaded.
Is it a valid OWL ontology? Please check with OWL Validator.

OWL 2 Validation Report
Summary

The ontology and all of its imports are in the OWL 2 profile
Imports Closure
Ontology IRI Physical URI
OntologyID(OntologyIRI(https://w3id.org/valueflows/))
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 16:38
maybe you can find a bug - i get it clean in the validator, and also in the validation stuff that Kalin did
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 16:38
:stuck_out_tongue: ... does it like .owl extensions?
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 16:39
huh?
i've done .ttl files successfully before
(but not lately)
i was wondering it it was something with the w3id.org/valueflows not really giving data at the right iri's
but i think we did it that way before
Brent Shambaugh

yeah, i took it down to one class, no luck
it worked for @djodjoni though, before I started messing with his .ttl file :disappointed:
at least i'm pretty sure, because he had a diagram
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 16:48
The uploader thing works?
for other .ttl files?
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 16:48
well, i tried an old .ttl file that used to work some months ago, and it didn't load
but it does load the foaf example
i tried both the visualizer and the upload
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 17:21
In /js/webvowl.app.js 624:8 of /js/webvowl.app.js : var classCount = parseInt(data.metrics.classCount);
data.metrics is undefined
I tried loading from the upload and dropping the file in /WebVOWL/src/app/data/
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 17:22
thanks for trying!
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 17:22
and /WebVOWL/deploy/data
I first converted from .ttl to .nt http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 17:23
well i guess it is good to know it is not just me / my machine / whatever
ah
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 17:24
then dropped the .nt into http://rdf-translator.appspot.com/ to convert to json-ld
I wasn't sure that extension to give it, so I just chose .json
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 17:24
don't know
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 17:25
as json-ld was designed to work with json parsers (from memory on conference call with Manu Sporny)
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 21 17:25
i should go back and try converting with whatever Kalin was using and then loading in webvowl
(but not today unfortunately)
thanks for trying all this stuff @bshambaugh !!
or keep trucking to pick a new visualizer
or try yours :blush:
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 17:31
thanks. data = data || {}; means it loads the data or an empty object if there is nothing in data (no file loaded?). Just for fun try calling the .metrics method? on .data. If that fails, then data needs to be defined (meaning no file loaded) ...

Build the jar

To build the jar file, simply execute mvn package. The built jar only contains the compiled source code. To build a jar file that can be executed standalone, you have to use the package option with parameter: mvn package -Denv=standalone or mvn package -P standalone-release. This will build the file owl2vowl.jar containing all dependencies needed to be executable. There will also be a zip file created containing the owl2vowl.jar, README and the license files.

edit: pom.xml : change version 1.8 to 1.7 ... It may break but not doing Java upgrade
cheating does not work...need to compile https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/OWL2VOWL on a machine with Java 1.8
Use the resulting owl2vowl.jar as follows: java -jar owl2vowl.jar -file all_vf.ttl
feed the result to WebVOWL

it seems I am downloading the web..
just a lot of stuff at repo.spring.io
8 minutes so far...fun
They surely did not think about the low bandwidth people, did they?
By the way. maven is a build engine (or whatever they call it) . It uses pom.xml to point to things.
the analog I see in JavaScript is npm install
oops...I need a compiler for JAVA:

It looks like it might run..I just need to point maven to it (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2503658/specify-jdk-for-maven-to-use)
I tried: export JAVA_HOME='/home/brent/Downloads/jdk1.8.0_121' in the cli console window I was using maven in and it did not complain that JAVA_HOME was not set

@fosterlynn I didn't get what issue you have with VOWL? for example this version of .ttl works http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/82b624f491b1151737899023b2708478cc0ac99e/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL
.ttl from current master also works http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL
Brent Shambaugh
@bshambaugh
Mar 21 21:10 
This worked for me: https://github.com/bshambaugh/ovn/blob/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.json (created from owl2vowl)
it yields:

http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL is what I was doing, which is still not working for me.
Noting the difference in the first part of the url, hmmm. @elf-pavlik your links both work for me! So looks like I was doing this in the wrong place. :(
Sorry @bshambaugh !!!
aha, mine is an older beta version, probably got that link from awhile ago -- sorry everyone!!

would you like a PR with a jar and script to run it. to perform and check if all transformations are ok ?
Kalin Maldzhanski
@djodjoni
Mar 22 12:14 
btw just qurious is there any specific reason why codeship is used ?
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 12:15 
where ?
Kalin Maldzhanski
@djodjoni
Mar 22 12:16 
valueflows repo?
Kalin Maldzhanski
@djodjoni
Mar 22 12:27 
the reason why I am asking is to setup this vocab checks and those automatic conversions including vowl json s they can be done on PR 
will save some time considering the issues @fosterlynn had recently
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 12:44 
would you like a PR with a jar and script to run it. to perform and check if all transformations are ok ?
sure, if it isn't too hard
but also, it would be just a warning, true? and wouldn't automatically generate the .png file?
Kalin Maldzhanski
@djodjoni
Mar 22 13:39 
it could generate all(various rdf formats and vowl json), and I personally would but the png as it may(most probably) look not that nice 
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:39 
yeah that was my worry about the png
need to move it around a bit manually
Kalin Maldzhanski
@djodjoni
Mar 22 13:40 
yep exactly
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 13:40 
i don't think we need all the formats in the repo
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:41 
which would you think best @elf-pavlik ?
and does this make sense to you in general?
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 13:41 
for vocab definition we can just stick to .ttl
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:42 
that is source, not generated
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 13:42 
i think we only need source in the repo
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:42 
would it be good to create a json-ld context?
ah ok
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 13:42 
we will need JSON-LD context but it != vocab itself
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:43 
no just something useful to have
but i don't really have an opinion on what to generate - and do want to make sure it is worth the time to do it (vs some other work for @djodjoni )
when i can't get my ttl to paint in vowl, i need to just fix it anyhow 
elf Pavlik
@elf-pavlik
Mar 22 13:46 
i usually validate .ttl with https://www.npmjs.com/package/turtle-validator
online service http://ttl.summerofcode.be/
Lynn Foster
@fosterlynn
Mar 22 13:47 
i'll give it a try, before it validated, but didn't paint - shouldn't be a problem any more
bookmarking
thanks
